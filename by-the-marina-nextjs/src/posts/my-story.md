## About Me

I am a curious and self-directed learner who is disciplined, organized, and motivated. I attended 3 different high schools in 4 years and lived in 5 different U.S. states and 1 country outside the U.S. (Japan) during my childhood due to my father’s work, so I am used to starting over and becoming successful in new environments.

As a military dependent, I have a large travel experience, so I am very comfortable and familiar with different environments, cultures, and customs. After high school, I took a gap year and spent the majority of my time as a dog walker/sitter before traveling to Ecuador to visit family in the summer.

In college, I have actively sought out leadership roles in student government and campus affinity groups, largely as a mentor and coordinator. I may not have as strong of a technical background as some of my peers, but I believe that I offset this quality by actively engaging with and learning from people of all backgrounds on a deeper, more personal level.
